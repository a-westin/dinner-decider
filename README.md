# Dinner Decider

## Installation

Dinner Decider provides users with a fun, straight-forward solution to a universal problem: choosing where (or what!) to eat.

No installation is necessary; simply visit the website by clicking this [link.](https://aimeecesler.github.io/dinner-decider/)

## Usage

A browser-based app, Dinner Decider allows for a couple different methods of selecting a restaurant:

- Utilizing the user's location, Dinner Decider will suggest a nearby restaurant at random. By presenting options one at a time, user's will avoid that all-too familiar feeling of information overload. Anyone who has ever spent more time scrolling through Netflix, trying to select something to watch, than they actually spent watching something will understand! Sometimes, less really is more.
- While we don't always know what we do know what we want to eat, sometimes we know what we DON'T want, which can be just as important! There are two optional drop-down menus in the sidebar that allow users to narrow the scope of their results, if so desired.

#### Credits

Dinner Decider utilizes the following APIs, as well as the [jQuery] (https://jquery.com) library:

- [Zomato] (https://developers.zomato.com/api)
- [Mapbox] (https://docs.mapbox.com/api/)
